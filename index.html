                <p>
                    Investing into a stock allows you to take ownership of a small share in a company. Purchasing stocks in companies that gain value means that your stock will also gain value, becoming more worth than when you bought it. You can then sell the stock when you feel that your investment has been worthwhile, or you change your mind about the company you own stocks in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However not all companies will gain value after you purchase some of their stocks. Some will stay around the same value and others may decrease slightly, casuing you to lose a percentage of your investment. This is where good research and experience can help you, so it is not advised that you jump into the market with a large sum of money and little know how.
