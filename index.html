            <h1 id="overview">Why Invest?</h1>
            <p>
                Investing into a stock allows you to take ownership of a small share in a company. Purchasing stocks in
                companies that gain value means that your stock will also gain value, becoming worth more than when you
                bought it. You can then sell the stock when you feel that your investment has been worthwhile, or if you
                change your mind about the company you own stocks in.
            </p>
            <p>
                However not all companies will gain value after you purchase some of their stocks. Some will stay around
                the same value and others may decrease slightly, causing you to lose a percentage of your investment.
                This is where good research and experience can help you, so it is not advised that you jump into the
                market with a large sum of money and little knowledge.

        <h1>The Different Types of Investing.</h1>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Day Trading</h3>
            <p>Day trading is when you buy and sell different stocks daily. This usually means you are trying to profit
                off certain trends happening live and this is known as the riskiest type of trading. In my opinion
                people should not take up this form of trading as it is similar to gambling and there is zero logic or
                strategy, just a 50% chance of a stock increasing in price, and a 50% chance of it decreasing in chance.
            </p>
            <p class="posneg"><i class="fas fa-plus"></i> No long term waiting</p>
            <p class="posneg"><i class="fas fa-minus"></i> Incredible risk, 50/50 trading.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Short Term Trading</h3>
            <p>Short trading is when you buy and sell stocks, usually on a weekly to monthly basis. This is similar to
                day trading in the fact that it is on a very short timescale. However short trading can be less risk if
                you can spot a good opportunity to invest, for example before a company releases a new product. However
                these opportunities may also be negatively received, and can also drive a stock down as well as up.</p>
            <p class="posneg"><i class="fas fa-plus"></i>Possible to find good opportunities for investment.</p>
            <p class="posneg"><i class="fas fa-minus"></i>Still very risky, short term stock price changes can be hard
                to predict.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <h3>Long Term Trading</h3>
            <p>Long trading is when you buy stocks and hold them, mainly for 2+ years. This reduces the risk of loss as
                minor changes in a stocks price on a daily/weekly basis do not effect your investment. Long term trading
                is predicting where a company will be in years to come, and allows for the natural growth in economy to
                support the success of your investment demostrated by the graphic above.</p>
            <p class="posneg"><i class="fas fa-plus"></i>Allows you to acheieve exponential growth in investments</p>
            <p class="posneg"><i class="fas fa-minus"></i>Can take 10-20+ years of committed investing to get great

    <!-- Why long term trading is king -->
    <div class="col-md-12" id="longtrading">
        <h1>Why Long Term Trading is King.</h1>
        <p>As explained above, I believe long term trading is the way to go when dealing with the stock market. It
            offers the least risk and can be extremely financially rewarding if committed to and well looked after. A
            good, well rounded portfolio will only require a handful of hours per month to look after if properly set up
            and maintained. The main reason long term trading is so powerful and works as well as it does is because it
            is exploiting a somewhat 'linear' trend in market growth. This growth allows you to make cumulative gains
            due to reinvestment. Keeping risk at it's lowest by investing in large, financially strong companies in low
            risk sectors allows you to achieve this cumulative effect that is the reason long term investment can
            achieve huge financial reward.</p>
