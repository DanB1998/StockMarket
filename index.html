                <p>
                    Investing into a stock allows you to take ownership of a small share in a company. Purchasing stocks in companies that gain value means that your stock will also gain value, becoming more worth than when you bought it. You can then sell the stock when you feel that your investment has been worthwhile, or you change your mind about the company you own stocks in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However not all companies will gain value after you purchase some of their stocks. Some will stay around the same value and others may decrease slightly, casuing you to lose a percentage of your investment. This is where good research and experience can help you, so it is not advised that you jump into the market with a large sum of money and little know how.

            <h1>The Different Types of Investing.</h1>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h3>Day Trading</h3>
                <p>Day trading is when you buy and sell different stocks daily. This usually means you are trying to profit off certain trends happening live and this is known as the riskiest type of trading. In my opinion people should not take up this form of trading as it is similar to gambling and there is zero logic or strategy, just a 50% chance of a stock increasing in price, and a 50% chance of it decreasing in chance.</p>
                <p><i class="fas fa-plus"></i>  No long term waiting</p>
                <p><i class="fas fa-minus"></i>  Incredible risk, 50/50 trading.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h3>Short Term Trading</h3>
                <p>Short trading is when you buy and sell stocks, usually on a weekly to monthly basis. This is similar to day trading in the fact that it is on a very short timescale. However short trading can be less risk if you can spot a good opportunity to invest, for example before a company releases a new product. However these opportunities may also be negatively received, and can also drive a stock down as well as up.</p>
                <p><i class="fas fa-plus"></i>Possible find good opportunities for investment.</p>
                <p><i class="fas fa-minus"></i>Still very risky, short term stock price changes can be hard to predict.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
                <h3>Long Term Trading</h3>
                <p>Long trading is when you buy stocks and hold them, mainly for 2+ years. This reduces the risk of loss as minor changes in a stocks price on a daily basis do not effect your investment. Long trading is predicting where a company will be in years to come, and allows for the natural growth in economy to support the success of your investment demostrated by the graphic above.</p>
