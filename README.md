# MilestoneProject

## Overview

This project is aimed at people that are interested in getting involved with the stock market at a very beginner level. I consider it a pathway so that people that have no experience can understand the stock market and then be provided with some useful resources to be able to go away and do their own research to become confident enough to invest.

The aims of this project are to provide an introduction to what the stock market is, the different ways you can trade in the stock market and the risks involved in doing so. It will also have links to several resources and helpful information so that further reading can be completed outside of the scope of difficulty this website aims for.
