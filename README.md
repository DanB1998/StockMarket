# MilestoneProject

## Overview

This project is aimed at people that are interested in getting involved with the stock market at a very beginner level. I consider it a pathway so that people that have no experience can understand the stock market and then be provided with some useful resources to be able to go away and do their own research to become confident enough to invest.

The aims of this project are to provide an introduction to what the stock market is, the different ways you can trade in the stock market and the risks involved in doing so. It will also have links to several resources and helpful information so that further reading can be completed outside of the scope of difficulty this website aims for.

# Features

### Navigation bar

The Nav bar is simple and easy to use, and remains the same on each page to allow for easy navigation of the 3 pages; Home, getting started and contact.

### Background image

* My main focus during this project was to keep the website looking very clean and spacious. As I think this is the best way to convey information.

* The background image keeps things simple, and goes well alongside some text that clearly defines the websites goal, to get you into investing.

### The main content

The main content is laid out using bootstraps grid system. I used this as I thought it was the easiest way to structure a website that is trying to teach a user something.

### Tiles

The tiles are designed for a more aesthetic way of navigating if a user has read through all the information and wants to continue to learn more.

The objective of these tiles was to:

* Give the user a way to follow up their learning and learn more about the stock market.
   * This was achieved by allowing them to visit different informative sites, and also link them to helpful resources that they could do further reading on.
